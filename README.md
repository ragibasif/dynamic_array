# Dynamic Array

**Dynamic Array** is a pure C library that provides a resizable array implementation.
It dynamically allocates and manages memory, automatically expanding capacity as
needed. Perfect for learning data structures, building C projects, or comparing
dynamic array implementations across languages.

- Inspired by C++ STL `std::vector`
- Educational purpose: learn how vectors work under the hood
- Not recommended for production without additional error handling
